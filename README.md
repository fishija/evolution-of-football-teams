# evolution-of-football-teams
Team project for masters degree UKSW

Project owner - Michał Wiśniewski
Github owner - Jakub Mikuła
Project manager - Damian Urbański

Project points:
1. According to the period, the composition of football teams varies.

2. We would like to visualize the variation of the team as a graph:
the vertices are the players
two players are linked if they both played during the same match
and the match was won by the team
links are valuated by the number of victorious matches played by
the two players

3. Choose 2 or 3 teams or more (Barcelona, Madrid, Liverpool, Legia
Warszawa...)

4. Choose a time period (1950 - 2022 for instance, but might be less or
more)

5. Find the data, if problem back to point(s) 3 and/or 4
   
6. Represent the graph
